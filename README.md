# client-server2_NetworkProgramming_2

Study chapter 3, where we create a file server and a file client..

you will notice that the server and the client have no idea about security -- any file can be downloaded, or overwritten..

See if you can implement some security features to these programs. such as limiting the characters that can be used to specify a filename, searching for special patterns in the filenames like ".." and more..

Likewise the client can use a "sanity checker" as well - at least checking to see if the file exists would be a good start!
